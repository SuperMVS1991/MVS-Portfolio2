##HTML Document Walkthrough
<!-- This HTML document represents a basic web page structure with a header, main content, and footer. Let me explain a walk through for each section of the code: -->

##Document Structure: 
    <!-- The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration specifies the document type and version of HTML used.
    The <html> element encloses the entire HTML document and specifies the language attribute as "en" for English.
    The <head> section contains metadata about the document, such as character encoding, viewport settings, and the page title.
    The <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag specifies the character encoding for the document as UTF-8, which supports a wide range of characters.
    The <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> tag sets the viewport width to the device width and initial zoom level to 1.0, ensuring proper scaling on various devices.
    The <title> tag defines the title of the document displayed in the browser tab.
    The <link> tag links an external CSS file (style.css) to style the HTML content. -->

##Header Section:
    <!-- The <header> element represents the header section of the webpage.
    Inside the header, there's an <h1> tag displaying the name "Mike".
    A <nav> element contains navigation links to different sections of the page (#about, #portfolio, #contact, and #navigation).
    Additionally, there are four buttons inside the navigation section, each with an onclick attribute calling different shell scripts (/path/to/gotoabout.sh, /path/to/gotowork.sh, /path/to/gotoapps.sh, and /path/to/gottocontact.sh). -->

##Main Content:
    <!-- The <main> element contains the main content of the webpage.
    It consists of three sections: "About", "Portfolio", and "Contact".
    Each section is identified by an id attribute (about, portfolio, contact) for easy navigation.
    Inside each section, there's a <div> with a class name (title-element) containing a <h2> tag representing the section title.
    Within the "About" and "Portfolio" sections, there's an image (<img>) and textual content (<p>) providing information about the individual's profile and portfolio.
    Each section also includes a set of buttons similar to those in the header for navigation to different sections of the page. -->

##Footer Section:
    <!-- The <footer> element represents the footer section of the webpage.
    Currently, it's empty and doesn't contain any content. -->

##Interaction and Functionality:
    <!-- The navigation links and buttons allow users to navigate between different sections of the webpage.
    Clicking on a navigation link or button triggers the corresponding action defined in the onclick attribute.
    The webpage is designed to provide information about the individual, showcase their portfolio, and allow users to contact them through various channels. -->
